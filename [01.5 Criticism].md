This manuscript is a textbook definition of "telling" rather than "showing."  It's a list of theological points, not a story. Here's a brutal breakdown of what needs to change:

**1. Lack of Narrative:**

* **No Characters:**  There's no protagonist, no antagonist, no relatable human experiences.  It's just a series of statements about abstract concepts. 
* **No Plot:**  There's no conflict, no rising action, no climax, no resolution.  It's a collection of bullet points, not a narrative arc.
* **No Setting:**  The "inferno" is described in the most generic terms possible.  There's no sense of place, no atmosphere, no tangible details.

**2.  Overly Didactic and Repetitive:**

* **"Tell" Not "Show":**  Instead of showing a person wrestling with doubt or facing the consequences of their choices, the text simply states, "The heart is hardened," "The soul is consumed by guilt," etc.  These are abstract ideas, not concrete experiences.
* **Redundancy:**  Many points are repeated.  "The inferno is a place where God is absent" is stated in various ways throughout the text.  Focus on showing, not rehashing the same concept.

**3.  Lack of Emotional Impact:**

* **No Emotion:**  The text is devoid of emotional resonance.  The reader isn't drawn into the experience, they're merely presented with facts.  Where's the fear, the hope, the despair?
* **No Vulnerability:**  The reader never feels connected to the characters because they never experience vulnerability.  There's no doubt, no internal struggle, just dogmatic pronouncements.

**4.  Dialogue is Missing:**

* **No Conversations:**  There's no dialogue to bring the story to life.  Without dialogue, the characters remain hollow, and the reader can't connect with their emotions or motivations. 

**How to Improve:**

1. **Start with a Story:**  Create a compelling story.  A character who is tempted, who makes a mistake, who faces consequences.  Use this story to explore the concepts of heaven, hell, sin, redemption, etc.
2. **Show, Don't Tell:**  Instead of saying "He was filled with regret," show the character's actions, their facial expressions, their inner monologue.  Use sensory details to create a vivid experience for the reader.
3. **Develop Characters:**  Give the characters depth, flaws, and motivations.  Explore their inner struggles, their fears, their hopes.  Make them real, relatable people.
4. **Create a Setting:**  Don't just describe the "inferno" as a vague concept.  Show it.  Describe the smells, the sounds, the textures, the atmosphere.
5. **Dialogue is Key:**  Give your characters voices.  Let them interact, argue, disagree, comfort each other.  Dialogue can reveal character, advance the plot, and create emotional tension.

**Example:**

Instead of "The inferno is a place where God is absent," consider this:

> "The silence here was a weight, crushing him.  He could almost feel the emptiness where God should be, a yawning void that swallowed every sound, every whisper of hope."

This sentence creates a sense of place, evokes a feeling of desolation, and suggests a specific experience rather than a vague concept. 

This is just a starting point.  Remember, the goal is to create a story that is both emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating.  It's a challenging task, but it's worth the effort.
